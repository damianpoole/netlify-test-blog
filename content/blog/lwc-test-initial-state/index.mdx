title: Mocking the initial state of the Lightning Web Component

Jest is a great tool for testing, there are so many different ways to solve testing
problems. I want to talk about a problem I have encountered and go over a solution
to it while testing lightning web components.

**Now this technique has a specific use case which I want to make clear. It should
not be how you test components by default, there are already loads of examples of
that specifically in the
[LWC documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/lwc)
and [LWC recipes](https://github.com/trailheadapps/lwc-recipes).**

My simple use case is this; we have a existing component which is a simple form
with multiple inputs. We already have tests to ensure our wiring and validation
works etc.

So for this example I have initially created a simple component which an obvious issue.

```html
<template>
    <div>
        <input
            name="firstName"
            value={state.firstName}
            placeholder="Enter your first name"
            onchange={handleChange}
        />

        <input
            name="surname"
            value={state.surname}
            placeholder="Enter your surname"
            onchange={handleChange}
        />

        <button
            class={buttonClasses}
            disabled={invalid}
            onclick={handleSave}
        >
            Save
        </button>
    <div>
</template>
```

```javascript
import { LightningElement } from 'lwc';

const setState = (state, newState) = ({ ...state, ...newState });

export default class App extends LightningElement {
    state = {
        firstName: '',
        surname: ''
    }

    handleChange(event) {
        this.updateState({
            [event.target.name]: event.target.value
        });
    }

    handleSave(event) {
        if (this.state.firstName === 'A') {
            throw new Error('BOOM');
        }
    }

    updateState(newState) {
        this.state = setState(this.state, newState);
    }
}
```

We've had a bug reported that when the form is filled in with specific
values and it is submitted it causes an error.

Normally when you are testing these kind of state interactions you would do something
like this in your test. 

```javascript
const input = root.querySelector('input');
input.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('change'), { ... });
```

Now this works fine for a simple component but when you get more complex components
you will need to dispatch more of these changes and potentially in specific orders.

In order to effectively test this issue however, we would want to have our components
initial state be set to what the reported values are. That way we don't need find
all the inputs and dispatch events for each one. Again my example is simple so this
step of dispatching events could be fairly complex.

**This is not to say don't think about appropriate composition of your components
but you may be inheriting bad practice etc.**

So with that in mind we want a simple way of setting some default state values for
our component which could be complex in nature.

The first thing we are going to need to do is to create a module which will provide
the default values for our state object and also a means of mocking them to be
something else.

```javascript
export const DEFAULT_STATE = {
    firstName: '',
    surname: '',
};
```

We'll make some tweaks to our component to consume it.

```javascript
import { LightningElement } from 'lwc';
import { DEFAULT_STATE } from './constants';

...

export default class App extends LightningElement {
    state = DEFAULT_STATE;

    ...
}
```

Now that we have done this we can now write our test using `jest.doMock`

```javascript
let createElement;

const createComponent = (config = {}, cmpClass) => {
    const component = createElement('my-app', {
        is: cmpClass
    });
    Object.assign(component, config);

    document.body.appendChild(component);

    return {
        component,
        root: component.shadowRoot
    };
}

describe('my-app', () => {
    afterEach(() => {
        while (document.body.firstChild) {
            document.body.removeChild(document.body.firstChild);
        }
    });

    beforeEach(async () => {
        // we need to ensure module mocks are reset per test
        jest.resetModules();

        // resetting modules means we need to re-import createElement
        let { createElement: create } = await import('lwc');
        createElement = create;
    });

    it('Should not throw and error when firstName is A', () => {
        jest.doMock('../constants.js', () => {
            const originalModule = jest.requireActual('../constants.js');

            return {
                ...originalModule,
                DEFAULT_STATE: {
                    ...originalModule.DEFAULT_STATE,
                    firstName: 'A'
                }
            };
        });

        const MyApp = await import('my/app');

        const { root } = createComponent({}, MyApp.default);

        expect(root.querySelector('input').value).toEqual('A');

        // Now we can test our failing logic when we call `handleSave`
    });
});
```

I have created a much more comprehensive repo with further test examples showing how
you would blend these technique with a standard way of testing your component. You
could also always have separate test files for these so that you do not need to modify
all you existing tests too.
