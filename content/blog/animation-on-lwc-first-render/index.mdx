title: Animating Lightning Web Components on first render

With this post I hopefully am going to explain how and why CSS animations behave
the way they do with Lightning Web Components. The scope of this project is simple,
we want to make an element within a LWC animate it's width when it is first placed into
the DOM. We are not relying on any data being provided via a remote request or a
method of this component being called by a parent.

The HTML is really simple;

```html
<template>
  <div class="bar"></div>
</template>
```

And the CSS we are going to apply;

```css
.bar {
  background: hotpink;
  height: 20px;
  width: 0px;
}

.bar.bar-grow {
  width: 100%;
  transition: width 1s linear;
}
```

We are going to use the renderedCallback to start our animation after the component
is rendered for the first time. Update the HTML template to use a getter for the class
property.

```html
<template>
  <div class="{barClass}"></div>
</template>
```

```javascript
import { LightningElement } from 'lwc'

export default class Bar extends LightningElement {
  animate = false

  renderedCallback() {
    if (!this._firstRender) {
      this._firstRender = true
      this.animate = true
    }
  }

  get barClass() {
    return `bar ${this.animate ? 'bar-gow' : ''}`
  }
}
```

But wait, theres a problem. If you run this code what you will see is the bar will
be full width and the animation has not run, instead it has immediately been set
to the end state of the transition.

A common approach I have seen is to use a timeout to change the animation property,
like so;

```javascript
renderedCallback() {
    if (!this._firstRender) {
        this._firstRender = true;
        setTimeout(() => {
            this.animate = true;
        });
    }
}
```

Before I attempt to explain what is going on here here is another way to achieve this
result without the **setTimeout**.

```javascript
renderedCallback() {
    if (!this._firstRender) {
        this._firstRender = true;
        this.animate = true;
        this.template.querySelector('.bar').offsetLeft;
    }
}
```

**_So what is going on here?_**

LWC rerenders using a microtask, changing a reactive property is not immediate, this is why
you can change a reactive property multiple times in a piece of code like an event handler
but only the last value that was set is what is actually rendered.

So when our component initially is inserted into the DOM and animate is set to false
this is done during a microtask. By changing the animate property we are triggering another
microtask to be executed to potentially rerender the element.

By enqueing another microtask the event loop has not proceeded therefore the rendering
stage has not happened and the UI thread which handles paint etc has not done anything.

Once the second microtask has happened we have updated the DOM again and now the queue is
empty therefore the event loop continues and we render the changed DOM. This is why the
first example just immediately showed the bar as being 100% width.

Now with the setTimeout example we are enqueing the property change to a task, not a microtask.
This means once the microtask queue is empty the render stage will happen and then the next
available task will be picked up an executed. We've effectively created a delay in changing
the property.

And finally the working version without a timeout, what is going on here. Certain properties
cause the immediate invalidation and recalculation of layout. This is called layout thrashing
and this helps us in our example by ensuring that the layout knows about the element having zero
width. So when we apply the transition class it correctly causes the transition to happen.

Layout thrashing generally is something you want to avoid, it is a common cause of application
performance problems, especially large single page applications.

**_As always the most important thing is to understand the concepts so you know when it makes
sense to use them and when they will cause you issues._**
