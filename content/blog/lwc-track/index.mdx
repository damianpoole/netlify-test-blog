Track is a decorator for Lightning Web Components, it's allows you to let the framework
know that you wish to have the component rerender whenever this property is changed.

[Simple example of using @track](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/tools/playground/bcQm51hUo/1/edit)

```javascript
class simpleRerender extends LightningElement {
    @track text = 'Initial value';

    handleClick() {
        this.text = 'Changed value'
    }
}
```

I have now trained aproximately 80 people in using Lightning Web Components and have helped
even more creating products for the organisation I work for. The number one issue I see time
and time again is the misunderstanding about how track works.

It will work for any primitive type and for object it will also traverse down multiple
levels (I've tested it to 13) of object heirarchy and track each property it finds.

A common misconception is that it is tracking the value of the property when in actuality it
is tracking the reference which is assigned to the property, this may seem a subtle difference
but the following examples will show that that is not the case.

Strings are immutable in JavaScript so changing the value of a property that is using a string
will always cause the component to rerender, that is not true for other types which are not
immutable such as object or array.

Since LWC open source 1.1 and Salesforce spring 20' release we have been able to not use the
track decorator and still have the component rerender when the properties reference is changed.
In order for this to be "tracked" the property needs to be used in your template, it will also
not traverse down objects like the track decorator.

This may seem a loss of a feature but I believe it actually makes working with state inside LWC
simpler to understand across multiple teams working for an organisation, it forces the pattern
of always recreating state which ensures that the component will rerender.

As we have seen from the previous examples, you always need to assign a new reference in order
to ensure that your component is rerendered. The only benefit to using the track decorator is
for automatic tracking of child properties within an object, I believe that if you miss this
feature the likelyhood is that your components are not properly composed, you've effectively
created a "god" component and it should be broken down in into relevant sub components.

With all that in mind, I honestly do not see the benefit from using the track decorator. In my
experience people get confused about how it works and it is a false sense of security in that
if I use the decorator my component will always rerender which is not true. By forcing yourself
to not use it and ensuring you always set a new reference to whatever is effectively being
tracked you will always cause a rerender of your component.
